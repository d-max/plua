Android application that shows flashcard with word.

Tapping on card shows word translation. Also there are two mark buttons on the translation card side: forgot and recalled. Choosing one from them helps the application to order words. That means, if you forgot the word it will be shown earlier, then the one that you recalled. This is simple implementation of [spaced repetition method][1]. And of course you can add, edit or remove words.
