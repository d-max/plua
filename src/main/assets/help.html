        <p>This application developed to help in learning of foreign words. It is based on <i>Spaced repetition</i> method.</p>
        <p>The main idea is showing word's card again and again with some interval of time. This interval changes after each card review and depends of word recall result.</p>
        <p> By other words, subsequent card review interval increases if you recall this word correctly. In case when you didn't recall word time interval of next review decreases.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="title">How it works</div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>The application uses simplified 'soft' method of spaced repetition. That means, there is no annoying notifications that next cards review session should be started.
           So, you are free to decide when use app next time. Also, you are not obliged to mark card as forgotten or not. You can just flip to show next word card.</p>
        <p>In summary, the application just show cards in order of priority. You may change priority by marking card based on recall result or you may just skip card to keep priority unchanged.</p>
